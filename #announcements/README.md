# #ðŸ“£announcements 

The #announcements channel should be a resource that students will pay attention to. To ensure this, the following rules have been put into place.

* Avoid @everyone. Instead, use the @notify role which ensures that both those who are interested events or server updates will be notified but those who are not will not be notified. This also prevents inevitable "pingspam".
* The #announcements channel, ideally, should be a place where server changes, events, and updates should be placed. Random, irrelevant questions, comments, or other unimportant messages should be placed in #general, #shitpost-central, or #media, depending on the content. #announcements is not an opportunity to post content that would otherwise belong in #general. Any irrelevant posts should be removed by a Mod. **There is NO punishment for this unless it is a repeated pattern.**
