`The Gupta Criticism Case of 4/28/18` shows that there are widespread concerns for PVSG, from completely unreasonable, to perfectly fine. Due to the fact that constant critique of the server is unnecessary, specifically when the "problem" is unclear, here at PVSG, we ask you to consider a few things when providing feedback.

> "Caring about a problem without giving a solution is complaining" - Max Banach, 2018

> "Neel, you can be annoying but you have good points sometimes. Just make sure that you actually say what the problem is and why its a problem, because otherwise it just seems like complaining." - Gatlen Culp, 2018

> "If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. ... We need not wait to see what others do." - Mahatma Gandhi, 1913

Okay, so basically, if you have an problem, provide a solution! There's a difference between complaining and changing the server for the better.
