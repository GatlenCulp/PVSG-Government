# Moderation

## Purpose of Moderation

The goal of the Moderator is similar to that of a policeman or a politician. A moderator represents what students want, and upholds the Constitution of PVSG. Additionally, a moderator manages spam and manages new users when they join PVSG.

## MEGAMOD

### Permissions

The MEGAMOD role is only for class administrators. There is 1 MEGAMOD per grade. MEGAMODs have administration permissions in PVSG. The future users of the PVSG will help decide who will get this role for their class.

### Impeachment

* 75% of users' decision, with at least 30% of people online to decide

Prerequisites

* The applicant must have been a MOD for one term
* The applicant must win a MEGAMOD election (see MEGAMOD Election guidelines)

## MOD

### Permissions

MODs exist to control spam, edit nicknames, and manage roles. MODs may kick users if necessary. MODs have mostly all permissions. However, MODs are not Administrators.

### Impeachment (as a result of...)

* Abuse of power (including individual harassment)
* Creation of unnecessary public channels
* Changing nicknames outside of a user's actual name for a prolonged amount of time
* A 66% agreement to remove a MOD

### Prerequisites

* None

## MOD Elections (see Rules #1, #5)

MOD elections will take place at the beginning of each school year and during winter break. Any student is able to campaign for a MOD position, and current MODs must reapply in order to remain in office. MODs can refuse your request to become a MOD during MOD elections.

## MEGAMOD Elections

MEGAMOD elections occur after every MOD election when there are multiple MODs in a grade which is entitled to a MEGAMOD but does not have a current one, or only when a current MEGAMOD retires as a MOD. The MODs in their grade each get one vote to decide who will become a MEGAMOD.

## Proportions:

* MOD: There should be 1 MOD per every 25 people per grade
* MEGAMOD: There should be 1 MEGAMOD per grade which has two or more MODs.
