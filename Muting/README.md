# Muting

Muting is initiated due to:

* spam
  * five random messages within 1 minute
  * five 400+ character random messages within 3 minutes
  * "excessive" spam over 10 minutes warrants a Kick
* racial slurs
  * see Profanity
* harassment
  *  a MOD, 4 students, and the victim must agree

Notes:

* An individual mute is 0-48h
* Mute times can be stacked (e.g. a racial slur and spam can result in a 96h mute)
* As always, MODs and MEGAMODs have the final say on whether a mute is deserved in all instances
