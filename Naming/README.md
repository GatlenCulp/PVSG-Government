# Naming

Discord nicknames must remain in the format `Firstname Lastname` and should only be anything else for less than 24h.

This reasoning comes from the `Calebism vs Anti-Calebism Case of 4/9/18`:

New members, ultimately, will not stay if students are referred to by joke names. Whenever a student is new to PVSG, they are usually also new to Discord and it is often difficult to become used to Discord and PVSG. Unfortunately, many of these members are uncomfortable with PVSG, primarily the 29% of total users who have never sent a message in PVSG. Without a proper naming system, PVSG is viewed as disorganized, and new members will not know who is who. Typically, this would be a minor issue, but PVSG was designed for growth, and is less of a "chill" server than other existing Discord servers, but as of now, it is impossible to even hope for growth without proper organization.

Discord nicknames other than `Firstname Lastname` can exist for more than 24h if and only if the nicknames include the user's real name in parentheses. Ex: "Clang Bang (Ezekiel Pereira)". However, this can rapidly become confusing, and it is best to use one's full name unless a different nickname is absolutely necessary. Additionally, such an issue, ideally, should be dealt with by MODs and MEGAMODS on a case-by-case basis.
