# Profanity

Profanity is entirely allowed in most channels, however, in academic channels (such as those in the CLASSES category), it is recommended to keep profanity to a minimum. The only usage of profanity that is not allowed is that of **racial slurs**. Use of a racial slur results in a mute of up to 48h.

Words similar to racial slurs (hint: [https://youtu.be/aQTJl2bwoZQ](https://youtu.be/aQTJl2bwoZQ)) are not punishable, except when repeated as to replace a racial slur, in which case it is similarly punishable.
