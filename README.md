Welcome to the PVSG wiki!

## Important to remember
Everything included in this wiki (except for Academic Dishonesty rules) **is designed as a guideline, rather than a permanent rule.** Ultimately, the mods have power to follow these rules and execute their respective punishments, without having absolute or unconditional power.

Any and all issues should be reported to a MOD. If MODs are unavailable, report to a MEGAMOD. External contact info can be found in the wiki footer.

## Why github you nerd?
Github saves all the changes made so that way if there is a change in the government you can see it and compare it with the previous rulings. It's also nice to use the markdown format for typing and the organization for all the different pages is nice.
