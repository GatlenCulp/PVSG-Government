# PVSG-Government
This is a repository for the government of the PVSG. There needs to be rules to stop the server from straying and to eliminate the arguments of the future to maintain the vision of this server. See the **WIKI** for the government rules.

## Why github you nerd?
Github saves all the changes made so that way if there is a change in the government you can see it and compare it with the previous rulings. It's also nice to use the markdown format for typing and the organization for all the different pages is nice.
